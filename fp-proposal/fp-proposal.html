<h3>Application Overview</h3>
<p>User starts the game by creating an account. After that, they are greeted by a welcome screen, and the game officially begins.</p>

<p>mining drill, which will mine ore even when user is not playing the game. When user comes back to the game, appropriate amount of items</p>
<p>will be added to the user account, at which point they will be able to spend it how they wish. Game continues through unlocking new types of ore,</p>
