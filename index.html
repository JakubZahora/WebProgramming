<h2 style="font-style:oblique">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was born in a small town called Zakopane in Poland. My family moved to United States around 10 years ago now,</p>
<p>and we have lived in Romeoville since. I graduated in 2017 from Plainfield East High School, and decided to study</p>
<p>Computer Science at Lewis University. I enjoy learning about theory of it as much as the practical aspect of it, and</p>
<p>I am excited to see where it takes me after I graduate, and what amazing things will be possible using computers</p>
<p>in the future.</p>

<h2 style="font-style:oblique">What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Understanding of how to create a pretty good looking website</li>
    <li>Better understanding of how the internet and the web works as a whole</li>
    <li>Learn more about Agile workflow!</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-style:oblique">My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p>My favorite hobby is probably road biking. While I do not have the courage to ride bikes on actual roads, I do enjoy taking</p>
<p>a ride through a nearby park once in a while. Using an app called Strava, one can track their progress and even join a couple</p>
<p>competitions regarding riding certain amount of miles in a week, and win some coupons on online biking stores! The</p>
<p>downside to biking is that it can get pretty expensive, as bikes usually are, especially today with the nationwide bike</p>
<p>shortage. Would recommend it to anyone, as a relaxing way to stay in shape and have some fun!</p>

<h2 style="font-style:oblique">Greatest Innovations</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Creation of UNIX: In 1969, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first version of UNIX. 
        That made a tremendous impact on computer history, and their creation led to the world that we have today.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix">Wiki Link</a>
    </li>
    <li>Creation of Windows: With Microsoft creating Windows for public consumption, computers were no longer only available to collage students and professors, 
        but everyone in the country!
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Wiki Link</a>
    </li>
    <li>Invention of parallelism in computers, where multiple instructions could be executed at once.

    </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-style:oblique">Fun Fact!</h2>
<p>When I was a litle boy walking home from school, I decided to cut through a horse pasture to save some time.</p>
<p>When I attempted that, my backpack got stuck on an electrical tape designed to keep the horses in, and after multiple shocks,</p>
<p>I single handedly took the entire side of the fence off. Would not recommend.</p>
